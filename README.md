# <Random-Dice-Roller>

## Description

This is a simple random number generator utilizing 5 dice. I created this project as a way to help further my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; all of which are deployed in this application. Throughout this process I learned how to create multiple dice using multiple front end programming languages, as well as a functional "Roll Dice" button.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this dice roller, simply click on the "Roll Dice" button to generate a random roll. Each time you click the "Roll Dice" button, a newly generated sequence will appear.
